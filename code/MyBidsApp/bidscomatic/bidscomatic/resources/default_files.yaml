# Purpose
# =======
# Fallback file-handling rules applied when a project does **not** supply its
# own *files.yaml*.  The schema is validated by `bidscomatic.config.schema`.
#
# Layout
# ------
# root
# ├── ignore       → glob patterns that should be skipped entirely
# │   ├── archives → archive names ignored *before* extraction
# │   └── files    → individual files ignored when walking a tree
# └── rename       → { <glob> : <new-name> } (reserved, not used here)
#
# Notes
# -----
# • All globs are matched **case-sensitively** by `pathlib.Path.match()`.
# • Prefix “*” and suffix “*” wildcards are allowed.
# • An **empty** file is legal (validation still succeeds) but these minimal
#   rules avoid common nuisances such as `__MACOSX/` or `.DS_Store`.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ignore:
  archives:            # Archives skipped *before* unzip/untar.
    - "*attached.tar"  # Export-class archives created by some PACS vendors.
  files:               # Files skipped when walking any directory tree.
    - "*.uid"          # UID stubs occasionally produced by dcm2niix.
    - "*.DS_Store"     # Finder metadata sprinkled on macOS volumes.

# rename:
#   # Maps *source-glob* → *target-name*.
#   # Reserved for future use; leave commented to keep the file valid YAML.
#   # some_file.ext: better_name.ext
