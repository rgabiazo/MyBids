"""
Helpers for identifying study archives.

This module contains *pure* utility code used by several pipelines that need
to decide whether a given file path points to a supported compressed archive.
Keeping the predicate here avoids code duplication in:

* The **unzip** pipeline (runtime extraction).
* Future validation or GUI layers.
* Unit-tests that fabricate synthetic archives.

The logic purposefully remains extremely cheap: a simple suffix comparison
covers all practical cases and avoids expensive `tarfile` / `zipfile` probing
during directory scans.
