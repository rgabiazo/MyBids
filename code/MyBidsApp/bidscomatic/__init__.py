"""Proxy module mirroring the packaged :mod:`bidscomatic` implementation.

The project structure places the real implementation under the nested
``bidscomatic/bidscomatic`` directory so that packaging tools can include
tests and auxiliary files. Importing :mod:`bidscomatic` directly from the
source tree would otherwise expose this lightweight wrapper module and hide
subpackages such as ``bidscomatic.resources``. Mirroring the installed
package behaviour keeps the public surface consistent during development.
